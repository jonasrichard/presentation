        Elixir with an eye of an Erlanger

        Language improvements
          - not a new infrastructure, uses that of Erlang
          - cleaner language constructs
          - macros against boilerplate
          - macros for new construct
          - unicode and string support

        How Erlang communicty welcomed Elixir?

        Actor model

        Application (library, otp)
          - {:ok, pid}

        Supervision tree
          - nice, there are a lot of good advices and docs
            but how to move forward?
          - separate children kinds
            - simple one for one? similar worker processes
            - one for all? let us have a clean start
            - rest for

        Don't call forward in the supervision tree
        Call backward
          - analyise the service dependencies
        When to restart?

        Examples
          1. User service, session service
          2. Save the ETS!
          3. Transient, permanent
          x. Chaos monkey
